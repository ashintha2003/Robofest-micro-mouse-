# Robofest micro mouse

This was my first project involving a micromouse, completed during our second year of university. Our team progressed to the semi-finals but didnâ€™t make it past the finals. Despite that, it was a valuable learning experience that helped us grow both technically and as a team.

We used the **ATmega328P** microcontroller as the brain of our micromouse.

I was responsible for the complete software development of the micromouse, including:

- Implementing the **Flood Fill** algorithm for maze solving  
- Designing the **PID controller** for precise motor control  
- Performing **sensor calibration** for accurate wall detection

This hands-on experience significantly enhanced my skills in embedded systems, algorithm design, and real-time problem solving.
